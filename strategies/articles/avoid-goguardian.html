    <h1>How to avoid GoGuardian</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">No more annoying GuGuardian that stops you from playing games!</div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>GoGuardian is a tool for teachers to look at a students' screens on their laptop, there is no actual easy ways to completely block it, but we can try to understand what GoGuardian can do, and use that to do our best to not let the teacher know what we are doing on our chromebook.</p>
    <h2>Teacher Perspective</h2>
    <p>In this section, I will explain all the informations I have to let you understand what a teacher actually sees via GoGuardian and what a teacher can do on GoGuardian to force you study.</p>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Direct Screen Looking</b><br><br>On goguardian, they have a main page of all the students' screen showing on the page, it will be very obvious if a student plays games, because a game is often colorful and has a lot of movements, and most importantly, very different from study pages. Games can be very easy to spot.<br><br>I got this information when my social study teacher want to force us to use our chromebook academically by sharing the screen of GoGuardian Page<br><br></li>
        <li><b>Tab Management</b><br><br>This is one of the most powerful tools on GoGuardian, it lets teacher sees all the tabs on this chromebook opening, that way even if your game is on another page or another desk, the teacher can easily find out. The teacher can also delete tabs on your chromebook, set the tabs you are not allowed to open, and set the only page you are allowed to open. Once this is set, it will be impossible to open any games.<br><br>I got these informations because I literally asked a nice teacher what is it be like on GoGuardian page and from my personal experience.<br><br></li>
        <li><b>Screen Delay</b><br><br>This one is very easy to understand. GoGuardian has 1s delay for your chromebook to send the current image to GoGuardian, so even if you closed the game tab, if the teacher get to his/her computer in 1s, they can still see it.<br><br>I found out this delay when I was sitting behind my math teacher<br><br></li>
        <li><b>Browser Disallow</b><br><br>With this tool, teacher can ban your computer from going into the browser completely so you can't open any tabs.<br><br>I know it because my browser got banned three times.<br><br></li>
        <li><b>Jump Pop Up</b><br><br>You might think that some games has a "The system might not save your changes" pop up, and if you press "Cancel", you can protect the tab from being closed. However, the tab will constantly pop up "Do you want to close this tab" because the GoGuardian application will try again after previous failure, and your chromebook will automatically jump to the game page. This can be very annoying if the teacher is behind you.<br><br>Completely from my personal experience.<br><br></li>
        <li><b>GoGuardian History Timeline</b><br><br>This allows GoGuardian to look at all the tabs you opened start from when GoGuardian is turned on.<br><br>I got this information by hearing my social study teacher saying "I've seen a lot of Gimkit on your GoGuardian Timeline" and testing.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>How to avoid GoGuardian</h2>
    <p>Now we understand what GoGuardian can do, so we can use all the informations we have to find out a way to go against it.</p>
    <div class="box">
      <ul>
        <li>Open the UNBLOCKED GAMES page when the teacher is not using his/her computer, switch to another tab or screen 1s before the teacher look at his/her computer. The game page is titled <i>Home | Infinite Campus</i> which is probably allowed to open in any classes.<br><br></li>
        <li>Having the screen recording of the student screen always ready to look at requires hell a lot of storages, neither school or GoGuardian will accept that. In the other word, the teacher can only look at the name, icon, and the links in your GoGuardian Timeline. If you have a game tab named <i>Home | Infinite Campus</i> in your GoGuardian Timeline, your teacher is never going to find out. Although they are able to enter the link, but they don't have time to check every single link every single student has opened.<br><br></li>
        <li>If your teacher bans the game website or only allows you to enter one single website, then you have to open it before the teacher turn on GoGuardian. To avoid the pop up jump, go to chrome settings and disable pop ups in your game website and GoGuardian Extension.<br><br></li>
        <li><b><u>THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP!</u></b> Make sure to turn off WIFI after you open the game tab, there is no way for GoGuardian to track you without internet connection. Don't worry, I've tested, your screen won't freeze when showing on the GoGuardian page on the game website, it will only show "Connection Lost".<br><br></li>
      </ul>
